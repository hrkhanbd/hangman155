## Project Description
The Hangman Game is a command-line implementation of the classic Hangman word-guessing game. The player has to guess the secret word one letter at a time, with a limited number of incorrect guesses allowed before the game is lost.

### Aim of the Project
- To practice and improve Python programming skills.
- To learn about object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.
- To understand and implement basic game logic.

### What You Learned
- Creating and using classes and objects in Python.
- Implementing game logic with loops and conditional statements.
- Handling user input and validating it.
- Structuring a Python project with multiple functions and methods.

## Installation Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hrkhanbd/hangman155.git


## Usage Instructions
1. Run the Game

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the game using Python: python milestone_5.py

2. Follow the On-Screen Prompts

The game will prompt you to guess a letter.
Enter a single alphabetical character and press Enter.
The game will provide feedback on whether the guess is correct or not.
