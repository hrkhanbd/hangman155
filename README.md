## Project Description
Hangman155 is a Python project that simulates the classic Hangman game. The aim of this project is to create a simple command-line Hangman game where users guess letters to reveal a hidden word. Through this project, I am learning basic Python programming concepts such as lists, conditionals, loops, and user input handling.

### What It Does
- Generates a random word from a predefined list.
- Asks the user to guess letters.
- Validates the user's input.
- Provides feedback on whether the guess is correct or not.

### Aim of the Project
The main objective is to practice and solidify my understanding of Python basics and to create an engaging game that can be played in the command line.

### What I Learned
- How to use lists to store data.
- How to import and use modules.
- How to handle user input and validate it.
- Basic game logic implementation.

## Installation Instructions
